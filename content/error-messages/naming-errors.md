Often times, our mistakes are hard-to-spot typos.
There's no shame in that.
The important thing is that you **always read the error message**.
Error messages point you to the right vicinity,
and often times even suggest the fix!
At the end of the day,
pausing to read the message is much more effective than guessing at what the problem might be.
