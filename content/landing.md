## Excel To Code: Helping Professionals Learn to Code.

Professionals have valuable experience, gained by arduous effort. _Excel To Code_ capitalizes upon prior experience in Excel  to help professionals learn to code.

### Our Story

We began talking about coding while Kofi worked at a software development company called _8th Light_ and Isaac worked at a professional services firm called _Ernst and Young (EY)_. In our respective fields, we had gained much experience. Kofi knew as many programming languages as Ziad Fazah knew spoken languages. Isaac had learned enough Excel functions to be considered by his colleagues the Excel "Subject Matter Resource."

Isaac eventually shared about his (admittedly odd) hobby: building spreadsheets to track progress towards retirement. He would talk about the importance of simple formulas, or the logic necessary to effectively connect business requirements to Excel functionality. Kofi began pondering how similar Excel was to coding, and thus began the _Excel To Code_ journey.

### Your Learning

Given your former knowledge in Excel, we believe you can learn to code. The concepts utilized in Excel are very similar to those utilized in coding. By emphasizing these points of commonality, we strive to make coding approachable and familiar.

Whether you desire to add a programming language to your skill set, speak the language spoken by your IT counterparts or become a functional software engineer in your field, _Excel To Code_ will be your partner.
