Throughout this course we will be learning how to write software for the web (i.e. making websites). We'll use a language called **Elm**. This is an unconventional choice, but here's why we think it's going to be great:

### One thing at a time

Traditionally, websites are built with at least 3 languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That's 3 languages, just to get something interactive on the screen!

Elm is a much newer language that generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on your behalf. **By learning Elm, you can create a real, interactive website in one language.** Instead of writing code in all 3 of those languages ourselves, we'll ask Elm to generate it for us.

### Focus on programming

This is not a course about websites. **This is a course about coding!** Websites just work well for teaching, since they are visual and common.

Elm lets us better focus on programming. We'll talk about this more in later lessons, but for now consider this analogy: what is the best language for learning music? Well, the answer depends! If you want to learn to play a country song, then you might choose a guitar. But if you wanted to learn music theory, then you'll probably work with a piano. That's because pianos provide **easier visualizations of core concepts** since all the keys are laid out in front of you. Elm is like a "piano of programming", which is why we think it's a great fit.

OK, enough talking. Let's write some code!
