Throughout this course we will be learning how to write software for the web (i.e. making websites). We're going to be using a language called **Elm**. This is an unconventional choice, but here's why we think it's going to be great:

### One thing at a time

Traditionally, websites are built with **at least** 3 languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Many online coding courses start with JavaScript for that reason. However, it's very tricky to make a real website with **only** JavaScript. In order to really understand how it all works, you need to explore HTML and CSS eventually. That's 3 languages, just to get something interactive on the screen.

Elm is a much newer language that generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on your behalf. By learning Elm, you can create a real, interactive website in one language. Along the way, **we'll learn concepts from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, but we won't actually write code in those languages ourselves. Why, you ask? I'll tell you!

### Focus on programming

This is not a course about websites. **This is a course about coding!** We are just using websites because they are visual and pervasive. Visual mediums are nice because we can **see** what's going on. Pervasive mediums are great because you'll be able to take the skills you learn here and build something real (albeit, still digital).

Elm is a language for making websites, but it also lets us better focus on programming. We'll talk about this more in later lessons, but for now consider this analogy: what is the best language for learning music? Well, the answer depends! If you want to learn how to play country music, then you might choose a guitar. But if you wanted to learn music theory, then you'll probably work with a piano. That's because pianos provide **easier visualizations of core concepts** since all the keys are laid out in front of you. Elm is kind of like "the piano of programming", which is why we think it's a great fit.

**OK, enough of me talking** let's actually see some code!
